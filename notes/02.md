# Chapter 2 - Boolean Arithmetic

Most operations computers perform can be reduced to adding binary numbers.

## Binary Numbers

- The decimal system is base 10; the binary system is base 2. Calculating a decimal from a binary pattern follows a formula:

```
10011 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 19
```

For a string of digits `x=xn,xn-1...x0`, the value of x in base b is the sum of `xi*b^i` from i = 0 to n.

e.g.

```
111 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 7
```

So if we enter `7` in a computer and press enter, some register in memory is `111`. Probably with 29 leading 0s, if it's a 32-bit machine.

## Binary Addition

The rightmost digit is called the **least significant bit**. To add binary numbers:

- Add digits from right to left
- Add the resulting carry bit (0 or 1) to the sum of the next pair
- When you reach the most significant bit (leftmost digit), if that sum generates a 1, there's overflow. Otherwise, the addition succeeds.

e.g.

```
  1001
+ 0101
-------
 01110
```

No overflow

```
  1011
+ 0111
-------
 10010
```

Overflow

## Signed binary numbers

- A binary system with `n` digits can generate a set of `2^n` different bit patterns.
- To represent signed (positive and negative) numbers, we split the available space in half.
- Almost all computers today use the **2's complment method (or radix method)** to achieve this. In a binary system with `n` digits, the 2's complement of the number x is
    - (2^n) - x if x != 0
    - 0 otherwise
- x + (-x) is always 2^n - which gives you 0, because it's an overflow 1 followed by n 0s

- An n-bit binary system with 2's complement representation has the following properties:
    - The system can code 2^n signed numbers, between -2^(n-1) and 2^(n-1) - 1 (need one space for 0)
    - Codes for positive numbers always start with 0
    - Codes for negative numbers always start with 1
    - To get the code of -x from x
        - Leave the trailing 0s and the first least significant 1, then flip every other bit.OR
        - Flip all bits of x and add 1 to the result (this one is easier with a computer - Not x, then use an incrementer chip)

## Benefits of 2's Complement

- Adding two signed numbers is the same as adding two positive numbers
- Subtraction doesn't require new logic, you can just do it as addition: `x-y = x + (-y)`
